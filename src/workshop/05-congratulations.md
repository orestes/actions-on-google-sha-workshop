# Congratulations!

Great job copleting the workshop! Now you have the skills to integrate with the **Smart Home API** and enable voice experiences in your projects.

Remember that Voice is just another interface, and you could use it to drive any experience, nnot just Internet of Things projects. If you want to learn more about the Actions on Google platform that powers the Google Asssitant, check out [https://developers.google.com/actions/](https://developers.google.com/actions/) for the best documentation, guides and resources on the topic.

If you're looking for another IoT + VUI project, maybe you will like [Paper Signals](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com), a very cool Voice Experiment by Google.

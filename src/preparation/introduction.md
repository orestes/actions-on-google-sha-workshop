# Introduction

## What we are going to do

We are going to build an Arduino project that mimics a **Smart RGB Light Bulb**. The project will connect to the internet on its own and get its configuration from the **Firebase Realtime Database**. 

We will then connect our project to the **Actions on Google** platform, and we will be able to command our light by using the **Google Home** app, or any other device with the **Google Assistant.**

## Expected result

You will be able to ask the Google Assistant to 

* Turn on  the light
* Turn off the light
* Set the light to green
* Set the light to 50%

Or any other commands that might apply to a smart light bulb.

This is what your smart light bulb will look like
